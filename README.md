## ðŸ”¥ Latest News!
* [Sep 28, 2025]: Update the detailed README.
* [Sep 25, 2025]: Release the official code.
* [Sep 25, 2025]: Paper on arxiv.


## Configurations
### 1. Environment
* CUDA 12.6, 64-bit Python 3.10 and PyTorch 2.5.1, other environments may also work
* Users can use the following commands to install the packages
```bash
conda create -n newtongen python=3.10
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1
conda activate newtongen

cd 'where_you_clone_NewtonGen' 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Prepare Models and Weights
There are 3 types of weights you need to download/prepare.
1. Download CogVideoX-5B and  pre-trained weights from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/CogVideoX-5b/tree/main)
2. The lora weight from Go-with-the-Flow: [T2V5B_blendnorm_i18000_DATASET_lora_weights.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Eyeline-Labs/Go-with-the-Flow/tree/main)
3. The learned ODE weights for different dynamics: already in our folder `learned_dynamics`



## Inference

### 1. Choose the Motion You Need

- **Linear motions** (uniform motion, acceleration, deceleration, 3D motion, slope sliding, parabolic motion)  
  Use `inference_linear_withprompts.py` since the object can be treated as a whole when rendering optical flow.

- **Other motions** (rotation, size changing, parabolic motion with rotation, damped oscillation)  
  These require separate handling because different parts of the object move in different directions. Each has its own inference script.

### 2. Modify the Models and Weights Root
Set all the *MODEL_PATH*, *sample_path=sample_path*, *output_mp4_path* and other roots to your own ones in the `inference_xx.py` 


### 3. Modify the Configuration and Prompts
Change the Z0 dict in *config_list* according to your need. Tips: set the size-related *s* *l* larger will have a better visual effect.
```bash
config_list = [
    dict(
        z0=[6.9901, 9.3459, 5.558, -4.8493, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0], # x y vx vy theta omega s l a 
        DT=0.02,                                                      # delta time between each 2 frames
        METER_PER_PX=0.05,                                            # world size: 360*0.05 = 18m
        chosen_shape="circle",                                        # the nearest shape of the object
        output_name="set_a"
    ),
    ]
```

### 4. Run
```bash
python inference_xx.py
```


## Training for NND
### 1. Prepare Physics-Clean Videos
Run the scripts in folder `data_simulation`. We also provide the simulation samples in the folder.  
You can 

### 2. Encode the Physics-Clean Videos into Physical States Labels
Run the script in folder `physical_encoder`. For Circular Motion and Damped Oscillation, please use `phys_encoder_circular_oscillation.py`, all other motions, please use `phys_encoder.py`.

### 3. Training Example
Before you start NND training, set the *dynamics_batch*, other root paths, and hyper-parameters in the `train.py`, 
```bash
python train.py
```
You can prepare validation Physical States Labels from upper step 1, or you can ignore the validation part in the `train.py`.

## Evaluation
We calculated the Physical Invariance Score (PIS) for evaluation.
The code is in the `evaluation_PIS` folder. First run  `sam2_pipeline.py` to get masks, then use `masked_physical_features_pis.py`.
